Hi, this is Huiran. I recently received Master of Science in Computer Science (Applied Study) at Carnegie Mellon University, and obtained B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2020. My research interest is Computer Music, including music generation, audio technologies, real-time performing systems and music information retrieval. I am also a trained pianist with over 20 years of experience.
