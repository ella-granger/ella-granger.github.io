Hi, this is Huiran. I am a 2nd year Master's student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and have received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. My research interest is Computer Music, including music generation, audio technologies, real-time performing systems and music information retrieval. I am also a trained pianist with over 20 years of experience.
